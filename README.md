ðŸš€ Completed My Robot Arm Project! ðŸ¤–

I'm excited to share that Iâ€™ve successfully built and programmed my Robot Arm using:
ðŸ”¹ Arduino Uno
ðŸ”¹ Servo MG995 & SG90 motors
ðŸ”¹ Programmed in MATLAB

ðŸŒŸ Added functionality:
âœ… Integrated HC-05 Bluetooth Module for remote control via a custom application.

Key technical achievements:
âœ… Calculated Rotation Matrix
âœ… Extracted Euler Angles (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) & Axis-Angle
âœ… Developed functions for Forward and Inverse Kinematics

This project has been an incredible learning experience in robotics, kinematics, and motion control. Excited to explore more advanced applications in the future!

A big thank you to everyone who encouraged and supported me throughout this journey!
